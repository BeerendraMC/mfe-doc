# Web Components

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow developers to create reusable, encapsulated components for the web. Web components consist of three main parts:

- Custom Elements: Custom elements allow developers to define their own HTML tags and use them in their web applications. Custom elements can be used to create reusable components that can be used across different web applications.
- Shadow DOM: Shadow DOM is a way of encapsulating the styles and markup of a web component, so that it does not affect the rest of the web page.
- HTML Templates: HTML templates are a way of defining reusable HTML structures that can then be reused multiple times as the basis of a custom element's structure.

Web components are supported by most modern web browsers, including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. Refer [MDN Doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components) for more information.
