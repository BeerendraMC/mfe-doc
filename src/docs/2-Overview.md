# Overview

### What is Micro-frontend?

Micro-frontend is an architecture pattern for building web applications that involves breaking down the user interface of a large application into smaller, independent parts or modules. Each module is developed and deployed independently, using different technologies, and can be developed by different teams.

These modules are also known as micro frontends, and they can be developed using different frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, or even VanillaJS. Each micro frontend can represent a specific feature or functionality of the application, and they can be composed to create the overall user interface of the application.

### Why Use Micro-frontend?

Micro-frontend has gained popularity in recent years as a way to address some of the challenges of traditional monolithic front-end architectures, such as tight coupling between components, difficulty in scaling, and slow development cycles. By breaking down the UI into smaller, more manageable parts, micro-frontend allows teams to work more efficiently and effectively, and build more scalable and resilient web applications.

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Micro-frontend

Advantages of micro-frontend include:

- Increased flexibility and scalability
- More efficient development cycles
- Easier maintenance and updates
- Greater autonomy for teams

Disadvantages of micro-frontend include:

- Increased complexity and coordination between modules
- Potential performance issues if not implemented properly
- Dependency management challenges
- Styling issues caused by mfe styles getting overridden by host styles and vice versa

Overall, micro-frontend is a powerful approach to front-end development that can help teams work more efficiently and effectively. However, it also comes with its own set of challenges and requires careful consideration and planning to implement successfully.
