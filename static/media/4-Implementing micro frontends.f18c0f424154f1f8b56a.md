# Implementing micro frontends

Implementing Micro-frontends typically involves breaking down the user interface of a web application into smaller, self-contained modules that can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently. The following is a high-level overview of the key steps involved in implementing Micro-frontends:

### Building Modules:

The first step in implementing Micro-frontends is to break down the user interface of the application into smaller, self-contained modules. Each module should be designed to perform a specific function or task within the overall user interface. The modules can be built using a variety of front-end technologies, including React, Vue, Angular, or plain HTML/CSS/JavaScript.

### Deploying Modules:

Once the modules have been built, they need to be deployed to a production environment where they can be accessed by the parent application. Depending on the architecture being used, the modules may be deployed to separate servers, containers, or even separate domains.

### Integrating Modules:

After the modules have been deployed, the parent application needs to be configured to integrate them into the overall user interface. This may involve updating the routing logic, configuring the composition layer, or making changes to the server-side code.

### Communicating Between Modules:

Finally, the modules need to be able to communicate with each other in order to share data and coordinate their behavior. This can be achieved using a variety of communication patterns, including custom events, message passing, shared state, or APIs.

Overall, implementing Micro-frontends requires careful planning and coordination between the various teams responsible for building, deploying, and integrating the modules. However, the benefits of Micro-frontends, such as increased agility, flexibility, and scalability, make it an attractive option for organizations that need to rapidly develop and deploy complex web applications.
